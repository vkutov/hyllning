            Unlike any other human, Jesus lived in heaven as a spirit person before he was born on earth. (John 8:23)
            He was God’s first creation, and he helped in the creation of all other things.
            He is the only one created directly by the Allmighty and is therefore appropriately called God’s
            “only-begotten” Son. (John 1:14)
            Jesus served as God’s Spokesman, so he is also called “the Word.”​—Read Proverbs 8:22, 23, 30; Colossians
            1:15, 16.

            The prophets of God who lived before Jesus foretold many details about the Messiah. These details would
            help others to identify him. We might illustrate things this way: Suppose you were asked to go to a busy bus
            depot or a train station or an airport to pick up someone you had never met before. Would it not help if
            someone gave you a few details about him? Similarly, by means of the Bible prophets, The Lord gave a rather
            detailed description of what the Messiah would do and what he would experience. The fulfillment of these
            many prophecies would help faithful ones to identify him clearly.

            <li>Further proof that Jesus was the Messiah became clear near the end of 29 C.E. That is the year when
                Jesus went to John the Baptizer to be baptized in the Jordan River. God had promised John a sign so
                that he could identify the Messiah. John saw that sign at Jesus’ baptism. The Bible says that this is
                what happened: “After being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water; and look! the heavens
                were opened up, and he saw God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him. Look! Also, a voice
                from the heavens said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’” (Matthew 3:16, 17) After
                seeing and hearing what happened, John had no doubt that Jesus was sent by God. (John 1:32-34) At the
                moment when God’s spirit, or active force, was poured out upon him that day, Jesus became the Messiah,
                or Christ, the one appointed to be Leader and King.​—Isaiah 55:4.

                The fulfillment of Bible prophecy and God’s own testimony plainly show that Jesus was the
                promised Messiah. But the Bible answers two other important questions about Jesus Christ: Where did he
                come from, and what kind of person was he?
            </li>
            WHERE DID JESUS COME FROM?
            What does the Bible teach about Jesus’ existence before he came to earth?
            <li>
                The Bible teaches that Jesus lived in heaven before he came to earth. Micah prophesied that the
                Messiah would be born in Bethlehem and also said that His origin was “from ancient times.” (Micah 5:2)
                On many occasions, Jesus himself said that he lived in heaven before being born as a human. (Read John
                3:13; 6:38, 62; 17:4, 5) As a spirit creature in heaven, Jesus had a special relationship with The Lord.
            </li>
            <li> How does the Bible show that Jesus is God’s most precious Son?
                Jesus is the most precious Son of The Lord​—and for good reason. He is called “the firstborn of all
                creation,” for he was God’s first creation. * (Colossians 1:15) There is something else that makes this
                Son special. He is the “only-begotten Son.” (John 3:16) This means that Jesus is the only one directly
                created by God. Jesus is also the only one whom God used when He created all other things. (Colossians
                1:16) Then, too, Jesus is called “the Word.” (John 1:14) This tells us that he spoke for God, no doubt
                delivering messages and instructions to the Father’s other sons, both spirit and human.

            <li>
                Is the firstborn Son equal to God, as some believe? That is not what the Bible teaches. As we noted
                in the preceding paragraph, the Son was created. Obviously, then, he had a beginning, whereas 
                God has no beginning or end. (Psalm 90:2) The only-begotten Son never even considered trying to be equal
                to his Father. The Bible clearly teaches that the Father is greater than the Son. (Read John 14:28; 1
                Corinthians 11:3) The Lord alone is “God Almighty.” (Genesis 17:1) Therefore, he has no equal. *
